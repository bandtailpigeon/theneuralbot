# theneuralbot

This is a Twitter bot that focuses more on analysis and replying to mentioned users. Note: this is intented to run every minute with crontab, so depending on one's Twitter API limits limits and where one hosts this code, the count in the mentions timeline may be allowed to vary. Additionally, common words are eliminated in the script itself, and you will see a list containing these words in the script.
